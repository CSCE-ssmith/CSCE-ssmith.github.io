            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>â€œTo achieve professional excellence at the highest level, while staying grounded
                in my values and personal integrity. I will strive to lead, grow, and succeed
                without compromising my relationships, health, or purpose. I want my success to
                be defined not just by what I accomplish, but by how I uplift others, stay true to
                myself, and live a life of balance.</p>
